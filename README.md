## Hi there 👋 Welcome to my [Github](https://github.com/ntdkhiem) Page!

#### I'm a senior student [@MHS](http://maldenps.org/). I love learning new technologies and always prepare for all challenges 💪.

## ☁️ I’m currently learning ...
Cloud technology and its amazing features and how tech companies used it for managing their applications and software infrastructures. 

## 💻 I’m currently working on ...
An online multiplayer game where players will compete to be the best in captioning a photo (meme).

This project is built with [Python](https://python.org) with the implementation of modern technologies to handle scalability and mangagement such as using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for containerize and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) for containers orchestrations and [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) (GKE) for carry out these tasks on the cloud ☁️ 

(Of course, this is an overkilled way to develop a small project but I just wanted to practice and implement things that I learned and to experience how real-world applications were build and run.)
